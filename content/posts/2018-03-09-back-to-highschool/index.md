Talk about career options for pupils of my old highschool

I was asked to do a short talk on the career options in IT for Henryk
Sienkiewicz grammar school. I agreed without hesitation. It went quite well, I
hope it helped some of the folks to made their mind.

It started with an interview (to be publish at schools website), and then a
talk in a classroom format. For posterity, I'm attaching the slides
below.
