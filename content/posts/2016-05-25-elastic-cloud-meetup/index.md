My talk at ElasticNL meetup in Nieuwegein.

I had a great opportunity to talk about [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud) architecture together with [Morten Ingebrigtsen](https://twitter.com/mortenin). This was an [ElasticNL meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Elastic-NL/). This time in a new venue at Nieuwegein.

The audience was great and we had a log of good questions. Thanks folks for attending.
