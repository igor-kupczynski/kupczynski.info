Productivity system inspired by lean and agile ideas which helps you focus on what is important.

Recently I've read an interesting book by [Jim Benson][jb] & [Tonianne DeMaria
Barry][tdb]  - [Personal Kanban][pk]. This book not only promises to be 100%
new age free, but also not to focus on doing more. Sounds unorthodox for a
productivity book? Well, it surely does sound interesting. This post is
intended to be a short description of the Personal Kanban (PK) process - it
should contain enough information to get you started. Please bear in mind that
it is also an enthusiastic description - I decided to summarize PK and not
review it, yet. However, in a few weeks I plan to write a companion post to
describe my experience with implementing PK at home and in the office and
evaluate it it more details.

I like to listen to stuff when running. [The History of Alexander the
Great][thalex] is high on the playlist, but Software Engineering Radio gets
there as well. This is how I got introduced to Personal Kanban. In [episode
196][ser196] Jim Benson gives an overview of the process, the book and
discusses what are the use cases for PK. He does a good job describing and
advertising it so I have decided to give the book a shot. Here are the basics
- the process is easy enough to get you up to speed in next 15 minutes.

Description
-----------

PK tracks items of importance for an individual (and not organization), such
as:

- tasks
- appointments
- small projects

It is based on *Lean* ideas, especially the concept of *Keizen* (continuous
improvements). The lean-inspired agile methodologies such as XP, Scrum and
[Kanban][kanban] revolutionized software engineering within organizations; the
hope and promise of the book is that Personal Kanban can do the same with your
own professional and personal commitments.

Rules
-----

There are only two rules for Personal Kanban:

### 1. Visualize your work

To navigate efficiently in your tasks and commitments you need to visualize
them first. This is analogous to a gas gauge & speedometer in a car. The
visualization should give you more perspective than a traditional TODO list.

### 2. Limit Work In Progress (WIP)

It is easy to over-commit - besides the work your are contracted to do there
are various errands, family commitments, interests & hobbies, and finally
leisure. The problem is that at some point you may end up with too many tasks
going on - and nothing closed. If you visualize what you need to do it's easy
to see what you work on and to close some tasks before moving on to the other
ones. The idea is that if you artificially limit the number of current tasks
you will be less stressed and more focused on finishing what you have started,
and therefore you will be more efficient over the long term.

Basic implementation
--------------------

You need to think about a few items when implementing PK. Luckily, the book
offers sensible defaults which you can customize to fit your needs. Remember,
it's all about continuous improvement and there are only two rules that you
have to follow. By the way, *kanban* means a *signboard* in Japanese.

### Canvas

Anything that puts *work you have to do in front of your eyes* can work as a
PK canvas. This can be a wall, a whiteboard, a refrigerator or a dedicated
software. It is recommended to start with a whiteboard - it offers a good
combination of persistence and flexibility, and it is an information radiator.
This is called the *kanban board*. The board is your plate with tasks you need
to focus on.

### Value Stream

The tasks are not static, they always in the context - they flow like a stream
through various states, reaching a completion at some point. Start with simple
states (or columns on the board): READY, DOING, DONE. You can enrich it with
time. The book gives you some tips, like *THE PEN*, i.e., everything that
waits for other people inputs or *TODAY* - a list of things you want to
accomplish today.

### Backlog

Write down everything you have to do. This is your backlog. Do not use folders
like *TOMORROW* or *SOMEDAY* - add all your tasks to a backlog (e.g. the READY
column) and then pull them further down the kanban board when you want to
focus on them.

### Limit the Work-in-Progress (WIP)

Put a limit on your DOING column. You can focus only on a certain number of
things at a time. This number is not static - at your good days it may be
high, but you may want to lower it during crises. The authors recommend to
start with a small number, e.g. 3, to get a feel on how many tasks at a time
you're comfortable with.

### Begin to *pull*

*Pull* means moving tasks between columns on the board. It is an important
concept in the book. It emphasizes that you are in control - this is the
perfect state when the tasks are not pushed upon you, but rather you make
informed decisions what do you want to work on next.

### Retrospections

Do a *retrospection* from time to time. Take a look at the DONE column, start
noticing patterns, think how do you spend your time and if it fits your higher
level goals. This is essential so that you can continuously improve
(*keizen*).


Important ideas
---------------

The book points out that the flow of the tasks is important. You can't commit
100% of your time to working on tasks - you need to include some slacks to
stay flexible and manage when new data comes in.

Another thing is that you can *fork* new boards for larger projects,
especially when you need a different workflow (columns on the board). You are
encouraged to tweak with the system. It is important that Personal Kanban
works for you and it is not your master or your boss. The kinestatic feedback
you get when you move the tasks can help you find a rhythm of your work which
in turn maximizes its efficiency.

Summary
-------

One needs a method, a system to organize their tasks and projects and needs to
make sure they are aligned with his or her long term goals. If not put in a
trusted storage, the tasks can overwhelm nesting in various corners of memory.
Retrospections are necessary to improve, but they are also helpful to see a
wider context of our actions. In the end, one does not optimize for doing
more, one optimizes to have a quality life. Personal Kanban promises to help
achieve a quality life - by visualizing, giving context and feedback, by
reducing overcommitment and by allowing one to track what was done. The system
is also easy to implement - all one needs is a piece of space to put *post-it*
notes or a computer with dedicated software (and there are various webservices
offering [kanban boards][flow], even for free).

Such promises needs to be taken with a grain of salt, but I decided to
implement the Personal Kanban process to deal with my commitments. Until now I
relied on a few TODO lists and a calendar (the form varied, but recently they
were both from google). Has my quality of life improved with PK? Or can I at
least run my errands more efficiently? Stay tuned for my next post on PK!
