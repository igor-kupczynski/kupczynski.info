Use a laptop tray to create a standing desk at home with (almost) no effort.

Looks like this standing desk is not a niche anymore. There are lot of
articles on-line about its benefits and issues the people are facing
(like [this][s1] or [this][s2]).

Anyways, I decided the last year that I want to try it. A dedicated
desk for standing can be quite expensive and also you may need to
ditch your current desk if your home office is small. Of course, this
was to be an experiment, so I wanted to try it with minimal effort and
cost.

Somewhere online (I do not recall the source now) I found a tip to use
a laptop tray on top of a regular desk. I bought [Lavolta][lavolta] on
amazon.co.uk for around 30 GBP, but probably anything similar will do.

Now my home office looks like this

I do not stand all the time, but maybe 2-3 hours/per day. Its great if
you feel tired or sleepy or if your back or neck feel a bit stiff.

The other thing that people recommend online is a gel mat to put
behind your feet. Maybe I'll try it one day :-).
