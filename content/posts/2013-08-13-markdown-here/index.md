Clean and good looking emails including code & math. Write them using markdown and render to html within your browser.

You need to write a long email. With all the sections, sub-section, lists,
etc. You need to put some code there (or just let anybody know what [God said
to make the light][god-mx]). Luckily for you, html emails were invented - you
can open the gmail UI and start typing... Wait. Did I mean *gmail html
editor*? The one that needs three clicks to monospace a piece of code? There
has to be a better way. And there is - use [Markdown Here][mh]. A plugin to
your browser which lets you write emails in [Markdown][md] and then render it
with a key stroke.

As Jeff Atwood puts it, Markdown is a *simple little human markup language*.
The chances are you use and love it already. Or maybe you've seen it on
stackoverflow or github. If you've never heard about it I encourage you to
read [Jeff's post][jeff].
