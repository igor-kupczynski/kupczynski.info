*Elasticsearch in Production, Lessons Learned from Deploying and
Managing Multi Billion Document Search Engine at Egnyte*. I gave this
talk on our search engine at [Poznan Java User Group][pjug]. You can

This was a very good event followed by a small chamber
discussion. Thanks to all the folks who attended and asked very good
questions :-) This was the first PJUG talk at the Egnyte office, I
hope there will be more to follow.
