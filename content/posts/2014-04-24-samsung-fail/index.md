How not to update firmware + solution.

I own a Galaxy S3 smartphone, which I'm quite happy with. Android has
its issues but the hardware is very good and samsung rolled a few apps
to compensate for the OS shortcomings. However today I was really
disappointed. They rolled out a new update. *Updated 2014-05-06 with a
solution*.

Take a look at the change log:

> Added new feature.

Really? Is this worth 50+mb of firmware update to add **a** feature?
And then, take a look at the incentive for me to update:

> Some settings will be reset or data erased after this upgrade.

OK, so I thought - updates are good, let's go for it. And the result?
I do not know if something was fixed or any new features added, but I
got three new apps, which I did not ask for and can't uninstall.

The apps are:
- SkyCash (mobile payments),
- Rzeczpospolita (a Polish newspapers),
- E-kiosk (no idea, but "kiosk" in Polish is a place where you can buy
  newspaper).

Two newspaper apps and one which sounds like a virus or scam, but
apparently it is a legit mobile payments company. Good job, Samsung,
please put more ad/bloatware app on my phone with the next update -
for sure I'll buy S5 :-).

# Update 2014-05-06

**Miki** in the comment below asked how to cope with this
problem. While there is no way to uninstall the apps, they can be easily
*disabled*. A disabled app stays in the device storage but does not
use memory and is not present in the application launcher. Please
follow the steps below.

1. Go to `Settings` -> `More` -> `Application manager`
2. Go to `ALL` tab
3. Click the app you want to disable, e.g. "Rzeczpospolita"
4. Click `Disable` (sometimes you need to click `Uninstall Updates`
   first, before you can see the `Disable` button)
5. The app is disabled
