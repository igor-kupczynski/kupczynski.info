I've conducted an Elasticsearch workshop at my university Career Fairs

I've conducted an intro workshop to Elasticsearch at Poznań University
of Technology today. I was there because of Career Fairs where my
employer wanted to attract young talents and make our brand more
recognizable among students and graduates of technical majors.

The workshop group was very small - four students, but this allowed us
to keep a good pace and we covered a lot of material. The interaction
was also quite dynamic.

I have to admit it was good to visit my old university and see that
there are a plenty of people wanting to purse a career in IT.

The accompanying scripts are on [github][scr] and you can follow them
if you want. If you need to build a cluster for experimentation see my
previous [post][post] or go directly to my
[another github repo][cluster] :-).
