Year 2016 brings new challenges. I joined Elastic to work on the Cloud team.

I've talked and blogged about elasticsearch quite a few times last
year. At Egnyte, we've built a search engine which allowed us to offer
great search experience to Egnyte's customers. It was based
elasticsearch and
[we've successfully scaled it up](https://www.egnyte.com/blog/2015/06/scaling-elasticsearch-at-egnyte/)
to billions of documents and dozens of terabytes of data. I had a lot
of fun learning elasticsearch and working through proof-of-concept,
implementation and then production deployment and scaling.

# Joining Elastic

In 2014 I was a n00b when it comes to elasticsearch. But I needed to
learn it in-and-out in order to confidently put in production a huge
cluster needed by Egnyte. One of the best resources out there for
elasticsearch deep dive are
[the articles written by the Found team](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/please-bring-back-the-foundation-articles/28084/3). Found
used to offer Elasticsearch-as-a-service. They were a small group of
very talented guys and no-surprise that they where
[acquired by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-elasticsearch-saas-provider-found).

I'm excited to share that in Jan 2016 I joined Elastic to work with
the Found team as a Cloud Engineer. My responsibilities there include
developing their SaaS and on-prem offerings --- Cloud and
[Cloud Enterprise](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-elastic-cloud-and-elastic-cloud-enterprise). I
have the opportunity to work with this group of super-smart folks
building distributed systems. So far so good :-) The job is quite
challenging and I've learned a lot about zookeeper, scala and docker
already.

# Elastic{ON}

In February we had our super-awesome
[Elasticsearch User Conference](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2016/sf). As
I work remotely this was a great opportunity to meet the whole team in
person. Especially that it was followed by All-Hands Engineering
retreat in Lake Tahoo.

I'm really excited about this opportunity and I hope that I'll find more
time to blog about Cloud internals. Stay Tuned!
